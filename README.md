# k6-project

Goal of this project is to house a performance testing suite.

# Tech Stack
- k6

# Structure
-K6
    - tests
        - samples
            - (houses examples of performance testing)
        - actual-tests.js
    - utils
        - (houses assertions and environment classes for abstraction and reusability)

# Required 
You'll need K6 installed locally. 
https://k6.io/docs/get-started/installation/

You can then test it by running `k6` in a command terminal.
If you face `k6 is not a recongised command` after installation/in VS code, you'll need to restart your laptop/pc.
